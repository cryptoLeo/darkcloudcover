This repository is an attempt to use TensorFlow's tutorial on time series forecasting, on stock data instead of weather data.

TensorFlow has an introductory tutorial on timeseries forecasting on its website.
This is the link: "https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/time_series" .
It builds a few different styles of models including Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks (CNNs and RNNs).
The tutorial uses a weather time series dataset recorded by the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry.
Our goal is to use stock data instead of weather data. And getting the output in unscaled and tabular format.
